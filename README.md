## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** A comprehensive overview of how raw data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling.
- **Model Selection:** Explanation of the classification algorithms used for predicting click-through rates and the rationale behind their selection.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Insights into the metrics employed to assess the performance of the prediction model.

## Project Structure
Explore the following sections to delve deeper into the project:

- **src:** Contains the source code for the click-through rate prediction model.
- **data:** Includes the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **assets:** Holds images, charts, and other related project assets.

## Future Enhancements
